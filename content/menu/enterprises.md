The transformation based on Cloud and SDN technologies allows companies to have an automated and more virtualized infrastructure for computing and communications, which adapts elastically to the needs of the business.


## Private Cloud

Our WhiteCloud Architecture brings all the benefits of cloud automation to Enterprises, complemented with container and public Cloud orchestration, with distributions of OpenStack, Kubernetes and ManageIQ, and technologies like SDN and SDS where applicable.

## SD-WAN
We deliver the SD-WAN promise through WhiteWAN, our Software Defined WAN solution, a technology that enhances private (corporate) services through the use of software controlled CPEs, which create a private Overlay network over the public network.
